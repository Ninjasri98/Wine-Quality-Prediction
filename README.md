Wine Quality Prediction using Random Forest Classifier

This project predicts the quality of wine as either good or bad based on its physicochemical properties such as acidity, pH, and alcohol content. A Random Forest Classifier was trained on a dataset to classify wine quality effectively. The model demonstrates an accuracy of 92.8% .
